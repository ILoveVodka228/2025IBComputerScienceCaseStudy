# Find the correct dataset for a specific chatbot

This is an exercise for thinking of different datasets and their advantadges and limitations. 

This should be done __after__ doing some research and study the definitions in the other markdown file. 

## The exercise 

Think of a **specific** chatbot for some use that you might think of. Then, think of the possible datasets that would be relevant for training that dataset. If you can, use real datasets that you can find in these websites:

https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?mod=texts&page=1
https://odsc.medium.com/20-open-datasets-for-natural-language-processing-538fbfaf8e38
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research

Then discuss the possible bias of these datasets and how they fit for the intended purpose.

Also you can use more than one dataset and you can imagine a feasable dataset (like in the example). 

### How to find information about those datasets

1) Select one of them: 

Example: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu

2)

Sometimes you can find the situation in the image, if not, click on the paper. Read the type of dataset that it is.

Then go to the images and find out which one are the actual set so you can get an idea of which type of dataset you're dealing with.

(in my case I had to go to page 17)

For example, this is a dataset to train (And/or test) your program with questions that have answers to do exams.

## The example from the booklet

An insurance company, RAKT that uses a chatbot to handle customer queries.

The datasets:

Previous history insurance claim data, customer service data, insurance policy data and medical data. 

An analysis

Previous history insurance claim data doesn't prepare you to _new_ insurances products and policies. This would impact it's accuracy. The dataset is relevant since the type of data is from the exact type that is needed. If the company is not big enough is possible that the corpus is not big enough. The data is very classified and readable.
