# Case Study definitions (in orden of appearance) 

Before getting into the case study definitions in Depth I'm using another layer of definitions a bit more simple to later get into these concepts. You can access [here](https://github.com/d-prieto/2025IBComputerScienceCaseStudy/blob/main/Context-definitions.md)

## Latency
[Expand bit by bit the different concepts from the booklet, with some more explanations in the marked concepts]

### Critical Path

### Machine learning dependencies

### Natural language understanding (NLU)


## Different types of analysis of a phrase by a Natural Language Processing Model
[Do a table of different types of analysis of a phrase and then explain them and their relationship with this context]

### Discourse integration
### Lexical analysis
### Pragmatic analysis
### Semantic analysis
### Syntactical analysis (parsing)

## Recurrent neural network (RNN)
[Build from the understanding of Neural Networks and gradient of a function from up above and explain the different concepts]

### Memory of the network

### Layer weight

### Hyperparameter tuning

### Backpropagation through time (BPTT)

### Loss function

### Vanishing gradient

## Long short-term memory (LSTM)
[Expand the the definition from the booklet with examples so everybody can understand it]

### Memory cell state
### Input gate
### Forget gate
### Output gate 

## Transformer Neural Networks (Transformer NNs)
[Build from the understanding of Neural Networks and gradient of a function from up above and explain the different concepts]


### Self-attention mechanism 
[Go in detail with this]

## Specifications of a dataset: large, accurate, classified, readable, domain specific, relevant
[For each specification write the definition and an example of a dataset that complies that specification and a dataset that doesn't comply that specification]

### Large

### Accurate

### Classified

### Readable 

### Domain specific

### Relevant

### The concepts of synthetic and real data in this context


## Types of bias of datasets. 
[For each types of bias expand the definitions from the booklet and be specific in why (if applicable) are these biases unfair or inaccurate]

### Confirmation bias: 

### Historical bias: 

### Labelling bias:


### Linguistic bias:

### Sampling bias:

### Selection bias:

## Processing the data

## Preprocessing  the input data
[Explain how do you clean, select, transform y reduce the data and how you improve the quality and accuracy]

### Cleaning the data.

### Selection

### Transformation

### Reduction of data 

## Bag-of-words algorithm
[Expand the definition from the booklet with examples so everybody can understand it]

## Training a model
[Expand the definition from the booklet. Try to find how big and how much calculations do we need for training a chatbot for this context and explain the concepts related to the hardware]

### Clusters of GPU

### Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)

## Deploying a model
[Expand the definition from the booklet. Try to find how much calculations and how big we need our servers to handle this type of chatbot or if we need to use Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)]
