# Previous concepts
These concepts are relevant to get some information for the concepts that we're going to work later. I divided because they are implicit in later concepts so understanding these are helpful for the next ones. 

## More generic lexicon tha is applied here

### Query
[Define a query in general and if there is a difference between query and prompt]

### Pipeline 
[Define a pipeline in general and a pipeline applied to Neural Networks]

### Architecture of a system
[Define what is the architecture of a system with several examples, one of them related to Artificial inteligence]

### Decision algorithm 
[Define what is a decision algorithm with several examples, one of them related to Artificial inteligence]

### Deployment of a system 
[Define a bit what is the deployment of a system with a several examples, one of them related to Artificial Inteligence]

## Deep learning
[Define what is deep learning and its limitations]


## Neural network
[Define Neural Network with examples and explaining the concepts bellow]

### Hyperparameter (in a neural network)

### Layer of a neural network

### Input layer

### Hidden layer

### Output layer

## Gradient of a function (and relationship with Neural Networks)
[Define what is the gradient of a function with an example and its relationship with Neural Networks]

## Dataset
[Define what is a dataset of a Deep learning network with some examples. Try to get specific]


## Large language model (LLM)
[Define and expand a bit, are there other types of models that are not large or not about language?]


## Natural language processing model 
[Define what is it and the difference between this concept, an LLM and the concept of Natural Language Understanding]

## Machine-actionable information
[Define what is machine-actionable information and what is not or how do create it]

## Extra ball: Tensor
[Define what is a tensor with your words so your colleagues can more less understand it]
